# Cloud-Bind
Cloud-based Drug Binding Structure Prediction

## Hello there!

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts for running [EquiBind](https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind) (geometric deep learning for drug binding structure prediction) and [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina) (molecular docking program with integrated support for scoring and optimizing ligands using convolutional neural networks) on Google Colab.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.

## Bugs
- If you encounter any bugs, please report the issue to https://github.com/pablo-arantes/Cloud-Bind/issues

## Acknowledgments
- We would like to thank the [EquiBind](https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind) and [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina) team for doing an excellent job open sourcing the software. 
- We would like to thank the ChemosimLab ([@ChemosimLab](https://twitter.com/ChemosimLab)) team for their incredible [ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) (Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints) tool.
