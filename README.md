# Cloud-Bind
Cloud-based Drug Binding Structure Prediction

## Hello there!

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts for running [EquiBind](https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind) (geometric deep learning for drug binding structure prediction) on Google Colab.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.
