# Cloud-Bind
Cloud-based Drug Binding Structure Prediction

## Hello there!

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts for running [EquiBind](https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind) (geometric deep learning for drug binding structure prediction) and [gnina(https://github.com/gnina/gnina) (molecular docking program with integrated support for scoring and optimizing ligands using convolutional neural networks) on Google Colab.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.
